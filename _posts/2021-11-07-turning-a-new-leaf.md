Here was MitandGrit’s winning entry:
> "This is a majestic tree from the house where I grew up. We always call it the tree of life. We've sadly had to cut some of the branches over the years because it grew too big and we were scared it would damage the house during strong winds."

> "Quick background story, family told me that people from our hometown bought this tree as a symbol of luck and fortune. When I have my own home in the future, I will definitely have a majestic tree as a symbol of luck and fortune as well. However, it will be a Cardano Tree xD."
