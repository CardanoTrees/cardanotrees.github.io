The CardanoTrees NFT project recently held its 1st competition, out of a series of 25, for an exclusive 1/25 NFT Add-On through their Discord. (Discord Link Here [https://discord.gg/d984qqvs](https://discord.gg/d984qqvs))

For this first contest, the rules were simple: 
- Post a picture of a real tree you’ve come across in your life, and include a real or fictional story about it. 
- The submission with the most reactions on Discord wins!

The Prizes: 
- A special 1/25 NFT Add-On: reserved exclusively for the winners of contests in the community.
- A new role on the CardanoTrees Discord: Divine Sapling 

The first ever CardanoTrees Community Contest ended with 88 entries. 

In the end, MitandGrit#1303 was chosen as the Discord’s first ever: Divine Sapling.

Here was MitandGrit’s winning entry:
> “This is a majestic tree from the house where I grew up. We always call it the tree of life. We've sadly had to cut some of the branches over the years because it grew too big and we were scared it would damage the house during strong winds. 

Quick background story, family told me that people from our hometown bought this tree as a symbol of luck and fortune. When I have my own home in the future, I will definitely have a majestic tree as a symbol of luck and fortune as well. However, it will be a Cardano Tree xD”

It looks like this really is the tree of life, luck, and fortune.
